The below given blog post has been moved from my old Telegra.ph blog to this one. The style and formatting would be a bit different but bear with me.

# What is Random?
Before some days I asked all of you on my Telegram Channel to pick a random number between 1 and 10. It was a poll and so one could only select a single number and stick with it. Now by no means, it was a scientifically approved dataset or a large enough sample but, as I predicted that most of the people will vote for 7. Because 7 **feels** random. I imagine the thought process when asked to choose a random number between 1 and 10 to be like, "Well I can't choose 1 or 10 because then it wouldn't seem very random, 5 is in the exact middle and that doesn't seem random. I don't want to choose even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8) because they are too even. I could pick odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) but 1 and 9 are too close to the extremes so I think I will stick to 7 because that **feels** more random."

Only 2% and 5% of the people chose 10 and 1 respectively. As you can also see even numbers didn't get picked that much.

Now this I imagine happens in the back of your head when you are asked to pick a random number but if you think about it, it really isn't that random at all. In fact, 29% percent of you people opted for 7. Whereas if you think about the random distribution it should be close to 10%. Don't believe me? Check the poll for yourself.

_"Sooooooo, what's your point, Aman? Do you mean to say that Randomness doesn't exist?"_ Well, the answer to that question is as many things, is complicated. I personally believe that the existence of Free Will is dependent on Randomness existing but that is a topic for a different day. So you might understand my horror when I realize that humans aren't that good at generating random numbers and neither are computers. So does that mean we don't have free will? Wellllllllllllllll, I don't know.

_"Wait what do you mean computers can't generate random numbers?"_ Oh yeah, computers are good at a lot of tasks and they are fast and efficient but when it comes to random numbers, they are bad, like really really bad. You see a computer works on a set of instructions, code if you will. And one cannot just program something to always give you a random number, that doesn't work at all. _"But Aman, I call the function, "random()" in JS, Python, C++ all the time"_ Yeah, you do but think of where do you get that random value? What exactly is a computer supposed to do? Think of a random number? How would it think? How do you program an algorithm which gives you purely random numbers? The answer is, you don't. It is impossible in software for one to generate truly random numbers mathematically. Because Math follows a certain principle and that is that 1 + 1 will always equal 2. No matter how many times you do a certain step or an iteration, the value of the answer does not change. As for your random() function and how a computer or your calculator gives you random values when asked for it, they use something known as a Pseudo-Random Number. It basically works on the algorithm using a seed value and some starting numbers to spew out numbers that are seemingly random to human brains but in reality, can be replicated easily if one knows the seed value. But that is not good enough for encryption.

_"Hold on, encryption? Also, why do I care about this Randomness? How does this affect my life at all?"_ Well for starters, your Free Will depends on it but keeping philosophy out of the way, every single electronic device that you use, the encryption on it hinges on these Random Numbers. Your Zoom meetings, your WhatsApp texts, your Instagram stories, even this page that you are reading this on, not just the end-to-end encrypted content but the Web, in general, relies on these seemingly Random numbers. It affects your life because if Randomness or really high-quality pseudo-randomness did not exist then you would not be able to even get online. Turns out generating these Pseudo-Random numbers is so important that people used to sell books containing nothing but Random numbers, you can get one of the Amazon as well.

One of the reviews on that book. Obviously it is supposed to be a joke.

But people did buy these books for a list of Random numbers for many reasons (generating lottery numbers, gambling, etc)

_"Well okay. That seems useful to know but then so what is the answer? Just give me a yes or no answer."_ Okay okay, calm down! True Randomness does not exist in the software but it does exist in nature. _"Cool, so how do I ask nature to give me a random number between 1 and 10"_ By clicking [here](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=0&max=10&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new). I am not kidding, every time you click on that link, it will give you a random number between 1 and 10. Or you can just refresh the page to get a new random number. So the service that you are using is random.org and they generate Random numbers by listening to atmospheric noise around it and then using that to get actual TRUE Random numbers. _"Why would the atmospheric noise be Random?"_ Well, that is because of Quantum Fluctuations in the air, now as to why is that random, please consult your local Physicist for that. One can also use Nuclear Radioactivity to get Random values, there is a great NumberPhile video about it, [click here to see that.](https://youtu.be/SxP30euw3-0) Or you could use the electronic noise that is generated by the very device that you use, technically this does fall into the Quantum Fluctuation thing, technically all of the True Randomness that we know of, comes from Quantum Mechanics but once again consult your local Physicist for more information.

  

_"So where does that leave us?_ It leaves us with a demonstration of True Randomness generated by our electronic devices. You can do this yourself if you have a UNIX-based system, which would be anything but Windows. All one needs to do is to type, "cat /dev/random" inside your terminal and then look at the random entropy that follows through. Now, as far as I know, this random information comes from a chip on your CPU which keeps track of all the Random noise(Truly Random) generated by all the transistors and components on your device.

I present to you, true Randomness in its raw form. Isn't it Beautiful?
